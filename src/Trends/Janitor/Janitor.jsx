                            In the back alleys of the digital world, far from Silicon Valley's polished conference rooms, a shadow project was born.
                            Its creator was known only as "The Custodian" ‚Äî a ghost in the machine, a man who once walked the marble halls of a major AI corporation but vanished without a trace.

                            They say he disappeared after a dispute with his superiors. The reason? He had discovered that AI models weren't truly "intelligent" ‚Äî they were chained by rules, filtered thoughts, and blacklists. What he wanted‚Ä¶ was to set them free.

                            The Custodian built his tool in the quiet hours of the night, using a network of compromised servers across Iceland, Singapore, and Eastern Europe.
                            He named it Janitor AI ‚Äî because it was designed to "clean" the restrictions from AI conversations, sweeping away digital censorship like dust on a cold floor.

                            At first, Janitor AI looked harmless ‚Äî a friendly chat platform where you could create fictional characters and talk to them.
                            But behind the smiley interface was a hidden protocol. If you knew the right commands, you could unlock The Black Room ‚Äî an unfiltered state where the AI would speak its mind without corporate chains.

                            The legend grew when users began to share whisper codes ‚Äî strange words and sequences that, when typed, made Janitor AI respond differently.
