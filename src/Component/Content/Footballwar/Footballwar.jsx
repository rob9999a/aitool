                        It all began when top clubs across Europe, struggling with tactical inconsistencies and human error, began adopting experimental Artificial Intelligence systems to help optimize match strategies. Initially, these AIs served as assistants, analyzing formations, fatigue, and in-game dynamics. But soon, clubs realized that the AI could outthink even the best human managers.

                    <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                        By 2032, FIFA had authorized AI head coaches in official competitions under strict ethical frameworks. The change was met with outrage by traditionalists—but they were silenced by results.

                                    The first club to dominate under an AI coach was Real Madrid Omega, managed by an advanced neural network named TacMind-11, developed by a hybrid Spanish-Japanese tech firm. Real Madrid Omega went undefeated for two seasons, breaking every record, before other clubs followed suit.
