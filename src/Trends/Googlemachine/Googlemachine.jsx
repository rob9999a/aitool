    question: "A recent experiment by Google’s DeepMind division has reignited a centuries-old question in a new form: Can machines dream?",

Internal activity showed that it was generating hypothetical scenarios, often unrelated to the training data. This concept echoes Google's earlier DeepDream project from 2015, which used neural networks to find and enhance patterns, creating surreal, 'dream-like' images. While DeepDream was more about visualizing what a network 'sees,' this new experiment hints at an AI generating novel internal states without direct external prompts." },
